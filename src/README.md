## Summary

The dirctory that will contain the actual polished "product" that is my custom x86 kernel. This will be 
a work in progress for a long time but will hopefully grow to accomplish a few goals

## Goals

Create an x86 operating system that will be complete with the following features: 
* Fixed Priority Pre-emptive scheduler
* Tasks / Threads that can run C code in tandem
* A file system
* Interupt handlers
* Blocking Semaphores and Mutexes
* Priority Inhertance (to prevent priority inversion)

These goals may be expanded to include a more diverse set of goals but these should be achieved first.
